## JavaScript outside of the Browser

So far we have only used JavaScript in the browser. But JavaScript can also be used outside of the browser.

Node.js is a runtime environment for JavaScript. It allows us to run JavaScript outside of the browser. Node.js has some differences to the browser. For example, Node.js does not have a DOM. But it provides some APIs that are not available in the browser. For example, Node.js provides an API to access the file system.

One thing that Node.js can do is to create a web server. A web server is a program that listens for requests and sends responses back to the client. The web server can be used to serve web pages or to provide an API for a web application.

## Running a Node Program

To run a Node program you need to use the `node` command. The `node` command takes the path to a JavaScript file as an argument. The following `node` command will execute the JavaScript file `index.js` in the root of the project: `node index.js`.

For convenience, our templates include a script in the package.json that allows you to run the program with **`npm run start`**. The template includes a development mode, that automatically restarts the program when you make changes to the code. To start the development mode you can use **`npm run dev`**. Take a look at the `package.json` file to see how the scripts are defined.

## A Basic Node.js Program

A Node.js program can be almost anything. It can be a web server, a command line tool or a script that does some calculations. Try out to create a Node.js program that prints "Hello World" to the console or does some calculations.

```js
console.log("Hello World");
```

```js
const answer = 32 + 4;
console.log(answer);
```

Run the program with the `node` command. For example, if you save the program in a file called `index.js` you can run the program with `node index.js`.

> ðŸ’¡ You can use the `console.log` function to print values to the console. In the case of Node.js the console is the terminal and not the browser console.

## Node.js Servers

You can use Node.js to create web servers. To do so you can use the `http` module provided by Node.js.

You can import a native node module by using the `node:` prefix. For example, to import the `http` module you can use the following code:

```js
import { createServer } from "node:http";
```

You don't need to install the `http` module. It is included in Node.js.

### Creating a Server

The `http` module provides a function called `createServer` that takes a callback function as an argument. The callback function is called whenever a request is made to the server. The callback function is called with two arguments: `request` and `response`. The `request` object contains information about the request that was made to the server. The `response` object is used to send a response back to the client.

```js
import { createServer } from "node:http";

export const server = createServer((request, response) => {
  response.statusCode = 200;
  response.end("Hello World");
});
```

The `response.statusCode` property is used to set the status code of the response. The `response.end` method takes a string as an argument. The string is sent back to the client.

You can access the `request` object to get information about the request that was made to the server. For example, you can access the `url` property of the `request` object to get the URL that was requested.

```js
import { createServer } from "node:http";

export const server = createServer((request, response) => {
  if (request.url === "/") {
    response.statusCode = 200;
    response.end("Hello World");
  } else {
    response.statusCode = 404;
    response.end("Not Found");
  }
});
```

> ðŸ’¡ Online you will find the abbreviations `req` and `res` for `request` and `response`. This is a common convention but `req` and `res` are very hard to distinguish so we will use the full names in this bootcamp.

### Starting the Server (Listening for Requests)

To start the server you need to call the `listen` method on the server object. The `listen` method takes two arguments: the port number and an optional callback function. The callback function is called when the server is ready to accept requests.

To separate the code that creates the server from the code that starts the server you can export the server object from a `server.js` file and start the server in `index.js`:

```js
// index.js
import { server } from "./server.js";

const port = 8000;
server.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server running at http://127.0.0.1:${port}/`);
});
```

> ðŸ’¡ When you call `listen`, Node.js will keep the program running instead of exiting immediately. This is necessary because the program needs to keep running in order to accept requests.
