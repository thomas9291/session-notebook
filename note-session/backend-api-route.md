## Serverless functions

There are different approaches to creating backend functions for web applications.

A traditional web server for example built with the Node.js framework Express is a program running on a server or virtual machine that listens for incoming HTTP requests - like a waiter at a restaurant waiting for customers to place their orders. The code for the Express server is typically written in a so called monolithic structure, where all the different functions and endpoints are managed by the same program.

On the other hand Serverless Functions are like little helpers that are only executed on-demand, i.e. when they are needed. They wait for specific things to happen, like when a web applications gets a HTTP request or when a database gets updated. When that happens, the serverless function runs its code to do the specific job it was programmed to do and is terminated afterwards.
Serverless cloud provider, like Vercel, take care of all the details like setting up the computer resources needed to run the code and shutting them down when the job is done. It's like having a team of chefs come into the kitchen, cook a dish, and then clean everything up when they are finished. This makes it easier for developers to write code without having to worry about managing servers or resources.

## What a server-side API is meant for

As we already learned in the JS Fetch session an API (Application Programming Interface) can be seen from different perspectives and occur on various levels.

APIs running on a server environment are called server-side APIs. They are provided by a _server_, opposing to the APIs provided by the browser (which is also called the _client_). A common use-case for such server-side APIs is to create, read, update and delete data; so called CRUD operations.

> ðŸ’¡ Take a look at handout of the JS Fetch Session to refresh your knowledge of APIs.

Serverless functions are running on a server! But they are running without any additional configuration and they will just run the Code that is in the function defined.

Example serverless function in NextJS (e.g. in file `pages/api/dummy/index.js`)

```js
export default function handler(request, response) {
  response.status(200).json({ status: "dummy api call ok!" });
}
```

Only this function is executed on the server and therefore called serverless. The function itself has no file-system or persistent storage but it could access a database if it wanted to.

## Next.js API routes

Our main goal is to build a database and to handle its data in our web application. To do this we have to create our own API routes inside of the web application and decide what information and data the routes return. Luckyly, Next.js provides us with a cool feature using simple and intuitive syntax.

It follows a simple folder structure: Any file inside the folder e.g. `pages/api/test/file.js` is mapped to the respective url with the same path e.g. `/api/test/file` and will be treated as an API endpoint instead of a page.

In Next.js, an API route is simply a JavaScript module that exports a default function. For example, a file called `pages/api/hello.js` creates the API endpoint `/api/hello` that responds with a JSON message of "Hello neuefische!". The handler function takes two arguments: a request object and a response object, which are used to start the serverless programm on vercel and handle incoming requests and send responses back to the client.

```js
export default function handler(request, response) {
  response.status(200).json({ message: "Hello neuefische!" });
}
```

### Dynamic API Routes

Next.js supports Dynamic API Routes to create API endpoints that can handle dynamic parameters in the URL path and follows the same file naming rules used for pages.

For example, if you want to create an API endpoint that can handle requests for individual jokes, you could create a file called `/pages/api/jokes/[id].js`. This creates a dynamic API route where the id parameter can be any value. If you want to get a single joke, depending on the jokes `id` used in the browser route, we can acess the `id` route parameter by destructuring it from `request.query` object.

```js
export default function handler(request, response) {
  const { id } = request.query;
  //...
}
```

> ðŸ’¡ Further information about [Next.js Dynamic API Routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/dynamic-api-routes).

### Static routes

Create static route by creating a new file under `pages/api/jokes/index.js`:

```js
const jokes = []; // fill it up or import it from somewhere else

export default function handler(request, response) {
  response.status(200).json(jokes);
}
```

Then you can access your first private API route with `http://localhost:3000/api/jokes` in the browser.

### Dynamic routes

Create dynamic routes by creating a new file with square brackes like: `pages/api/jokes/[id].s`:

```js
const jokes = [{ id: 0, joke: "only bad joke here" }]; // fill it up or import it from somewhere else

export default function handler(request, response) {
  /* the values from query object are always strings and the id from the jokes is a number
   *  -> we need to convert the string to a number with parseInt
   */
  const id = parseInt(request.query.id);
  const joke = jokes.find((j) => j.id === id);
  if (!joke) {
    response.status(404).json({ status: "Joke not found" });
    return;
  }
  response.status(200).json(jokes);
}
```

Then you can access your dynamic private API routes with `http://localhost:3000/api/jokes/0` in the browser.

## Using private API routes in your React application

In React you can use your private API routes by just using the `useSWR` hook like before but passing the relative URL to it instead:

```js
const { data } = useSWR(id ? `/api/jokes/${id}` : null);
```

Note that you **DON'T** need to pass the whole host with `http://localhost:3000` because you are running your frontend and backend application together in NextJS.

## How to deploy NextJS App (including API) to Vercel

1. Sign up at vercel.com with your GitHub account.
2. Then visit https://vercel.com/new where you can choose from a repository from your GitHub profile which should be deployed. Choose one where you have a NextJS application
3. On the next screen leave the default options as they are and click `deploy`
4. Wait up to 5 minutes and then use the link that is provided to you
5. You can now test your whole application including the API routes you have defined

## How to log/debug with `console.log()`

You can use the `console.log()` function to debug your web application and understand what is happening within your API Routes. Since the API handlers are executed on the server, the console output will be displayed in your terminal (localhost) where you started the development server (`npm run dev`) or in the Vercel web interface (vercel deployment).

> ðŸ’¡ Further information about [Vercel Runtime Logs](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/observability/runtime-logs)

You can always put console.log() in the handler function (e.g. in `pages/api/jokes/index.js`)
You will see the result then in the running terminal where you started your application with `npm run dev`
Tipp: Install the [Console Ninja](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=WallabyJs.console-ninja) VSCode extension for better readability of your logs.

### Logging/debugging for deployed running server on Vercel

You can have a look into your dashboard of Vercel for your deployed backend and have a look into the logs.
