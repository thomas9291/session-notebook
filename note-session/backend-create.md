## CRUD and REST

### CRUD

The acronym CRUD [kÉ¹ÊŒd] covers the four basic operations of persistent storage

- **Create**, _create a record_,
- **Read** or **Retrieve**, _read a record_,
- **Update**, _update a record_, and
- **Delete** or **Destroy**, _delete a record_.

These operations can be expressed using different terms depending on context or environment.

| CRUD                      | MongoDB                    | SQL      | HTTP Method | typical Rest URL (with HTTP Method)     |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------- | -------- | ----------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Create**                | `insertOne` / `insertMany` | `INSERT` | POST        | `/todos`                                |
| **Read** or **Retrieve**  | `findOne` / `find`         | `SELECT` | GET         | `/todos/[todoId]` (one), `/todos` (all) |
| **Update**                | `updateOne` / `updateMany` | `UPDATE` | PUT / PATCH | `/todos/[todoId] `                      |
| **Delete** or **Destroy** | `deleteOne` / `deleteMany` | `DELETE` | DELETE      | `/todos/[todoId]`                       |

> ðŸ’¡ Note that the **Create** operation refers to the HTTP method `POST`. You'll need the corresponding HTTP method whenever you want to perform one of the **CRUD** operations.

### REST

REST is short for "Representational State Transfer" and refers to architectural principles and constraints how to structure your API.

We use CRUD operations and HTTP methods with a REST API.

> ðŸ’¡ This is a very basic and incomplete explanation. If you're interested in learning more about

## Create with Mongoose

To create a new entry in your database, you need to define a `POST` API route:

```js
// pages/api/index.js
if (request.method === "POST") {
  try {
    const jokeData = request.body;
    // We're declaring jokeData to contain the body of our request sent by our form that we haven't created yet.
    // The body of our request might contain data in a variety of formats, but is typically an object.
    const joke = new Joke(jokeData);
    // Utilizing our Joke scheme, we're creating a new joke.
    // At this point we're sanitizing our data according to the schema of our Joke model.
    await joke.save();
    // We've created a new joke, now we're calling save() to have mongoose insert a new document into our database.

    // The three lines above are functionally the same as:
    // Joke.create(request.body)
    // It's just a somewhat less opaque way.

    response.status(201).json({ status: "Joke created" });
  } catch (error) {
    console.log(error);
    response.status(400).json({ error: error.message });
  }
}
```

Note that the `POST` route alone does not create a new entry in your database: you need to tell your form's submit handler to use this route.

> ðŸ“™ Read more in the [mongoose docs](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/models.html#constructing-documents), but don't get confused: they suggest `.create` and `.insertMany()`.

## `POST` using `fetch`

To connect the form submit handler with your `POST` API route, you need to call `fetch()` with two arguments: the `POST API route` and an `options` object.

In this object, you set the HTTP method to `POST` (instead of the default `GET`) and specify the value for the `body` key (= the data you want to send).

> ðŸ’¡ The `body` key represent the `request.body` in the API route above: this is where the actual data is passed from frontend to the API (and then to the backend aka database).

```js
import useSWR from "swr";

export default function JokeForm() {
  const jokes = useSWR("/api/jokes");
  // We're declaring jokes here because we call the .mutate() method below.

  async function handleSubmit(event) {
    event.preventDefault();

    const formData = new FormData(event.target);
    const jokeData = Object.fromEntries(formData);
    // We're declaring jokeData and filling it with the values we've extracted from our form via Object.fromEntries().

    const response = await fetch("/api/jokes", {
      method: "POST",
      body: JSON.stringify(jokeData),
      headers: {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
      },
    });
    // Here we're using the API route we've built earlier.
    // We're declaring a response returning a promise while we're posting to our database.

    // Here we're using fetch and not swr, because swr is for data fetching, and not data mutation.
    // ... but we can notify swr about data changes using the mutate function! (See below.)

    // Our method is post, the body contains our jokeData JSON, and our header provides additional information about the data we're sending.

    // Our joke is on its way!

    if (response.ok) {
      // If our attempt at posting our joke is a success, we proceed here.
      await response.json();
      // At this point, the promise of response has resolved.
      jokes.mutate();
      // Now we're notifying swr that our data has been mutated, which will trigger a rerender.
      // If we don't include this line, the page won't automatically refresh and our submitted joke won't be immediately visible.
      event.target.reset();
    } else {
      console.error(`Error: ${response.status}`);
    }
  }
}
```

## Revalidation with `swr`'s `mutate()` function

In the example above, you've already seen how to use `jokes.mutate()`.

This is why we use it:

- it marks the data as expired and triggers a refetch (in the above example, `api/jokes` is fetched again)
- `swr` updates the cache automatically (i.e. faster page reloads and the correct data is displayed)
